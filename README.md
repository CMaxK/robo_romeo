# Robo-Romeo

- Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to design the batch for training dataset.
- Utilised CNN model (EfficientNetB0) to encode images into vectors and added embedded layer to tokenize the captions corresponding with images.
- Established the LSTM model and trained it using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Vertex AI to predict the next word of sequences and output whole sentences. 
- Built up the scoring function which using doc2vec to transfer sentences into vectors and calculate the cosine similarities to evaluate the performance of image captioning. 
- Imported open API called GPT-3 to output the beautiful poetry according to information gathered from images. 
- Developed a website using Streamlit to present the both poetry and robot voices. 



# Introduction - can AI be creative?

Some intro words on problem, solution, techniques

# Solution structure

Neural networks used:
- CNN
- LSTM
- GTP3

Training on over 118k images and cpations

Tasks split in 2 parts:
- look through image and generate caption
- turn caption into poetry

# Image encoding using CNN (EfficientNetB0)

- image encoding

# Word embedding and sequencing using LSTM

- LSTM

# Poetry generation using GP3

# Bonus - Attention layer

Some words on this special attention layer that we added
