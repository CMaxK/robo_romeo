# Introduction - can AI be creative?

Some intro words on problem, solution, techniques

# Solution structure

Neural networks used:
- CNN
- LSTM
- GTP3

Training on over 118k images and cpations

Tasks split in 2 parts:
- look through image and generate caption
- turn caption into poetry

# Image encoding using CNN (EfficientNetB0)

- image encoding

# Word embedding and sequencing using LSTM

- LSTM

# Poetry generation using GP3

# Bonus - Attention layer

Some words on this special attention layer that we added
